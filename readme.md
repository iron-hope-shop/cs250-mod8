# Sprint Review and Retrospective
In this journal assignment, you will make a new submission to your portfolio. Remember that you will submit portfolio artifacts in different courses throughout the Computer Science program. This portfolio is an opportunity for you to catalog your learning and showcase your best work to future employers. You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting will help add context to refresh your memory when you review your portfolio in the future.  

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Communication is important when assessing the needs of the end user and translating them into a user story.  Understanding the fundamental business need for a particular project or enhancement is an essential step in writing user stories.  User stories consist of a few key points and are meant to guide a developer through implementing a change to a project.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I have had the luck of already professionally developing programs.  Planning is crucial to the beginning of a project for a multitude of reasons.  I use JIRA for project planning and from Jan - Aug I was the scrum master for my team.  Segmenting project phases into epics and creating tasks in the form of stories are the easiest way to adopt agile.  I also had to schedule a recurring standup meeting, sprint planning, and retros for the team.  We were assigned a scrum master in August and honestly I hope I never have to be a scrum master again (but at least I am prepared to do so!).

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software development means that you are not only reliable, kind, and understanding with your team; no, it also means that you have expectations for the quality of your work, deadlines, and you are not only a peer but a teacher and student to all.
